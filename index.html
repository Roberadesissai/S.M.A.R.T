              My name is Robera Desissa. I am currently in my third year at The
              Ohio State University, I study Electrical and Computer
              Engineering. For my majer I am planeing to learn Artificial
              Intelligence (AI). Technology inspires me a lot, so that is why
              I chose this kind of field as my major and miner. So to stay on
              task, I use many study tools and strategies from Books and
              my class "Learn & Motivation."

          <p>
            The Book that helps me my learning and gets motivated in all my
            classes and to get a better understanding of all courses is"The New
            Science Of Learning" by Terry Doyle and Todd Zakrajsek. This Book talks about how there are many ways to understand what you
            learn in class or anywhere, And it shows you the best strategy to use
            in any circumstance. One of the strategies I found most
            interesting that I start using is "Find a pattern in learning," so
            basically, the strategy is about how you connect what you learn with
            something and find what makes them the same or different if you can 
            identify that you understand. This is one of many things that I
            have learned from this Book; there is a lot you should read this Book if you
            want to understand your learning differently and efficiently. There
            is another book that helped me as well, and this Book is called "College
            Student Skills". This Book tells you how to manage your time, stress, take notes, and so on. I recommend those books
            if you want to move forward in your success.

          <h2>Strategies</h2>
          <p>
            In the book "The New Science Of Learning," there are many ideas
            or strategies to try. One of the strategies that I use is "Pattern
            and learning", "Mindsets toward learning," and "Paying attention."
            There helps me a lot; the Pattern and learning are about how
            to find ways in what you learn and try to connect with the thing
            you know. I you this idea in one of my classes trying to find the
            Patterns between my understanding and the natural world projects 
            help prepare me for my future job. The second idea is
            Mindsets help me to be constant in my learning, which means if I
            set my mind that I can pass all my classes and do all the requirements,
            I have the mindset to do all my work with motivation. The third
            idea is paying attention. This idea was challenging because I could not
            fouce for a while if I were studying or learning, so I tried to combine
            my other theory with this so each idea would support the other. For
            example, if I lose my attention, I try to find patterns in my learning so
            I can stay motivated or give myself five minutes of a break to not get
            bored. Over, all those strategies help.
