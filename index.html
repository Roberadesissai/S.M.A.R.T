          <h2>BOOK</h2>
          <p>
            The Book that help me for my learning and to get motiveate in my all
            class and to get better understanding in all course is"The New
            Science Of Learning" by Terry Doyle and Todd Zakrajsek. This Book is
            basicle talk about that there is a lot of way to understan what you
            lean in class or anywhere, And it show you the best stratage to use
            in any cercemstansis. One of the stratage that i found most
            intersting that i start useing is "Find a pattern in learning", so
            basicle the stratage is about how you connect what you learn in with
            somthing and find what make them same or different, if you ca real
            identify that you real understand. This is not the only thing that i
            learn from this book there is a lot you sholud read this book if you
            want to understan your learing in diffrent way and easy way. There
            is anthor book that help me as well and this book is called "College
            Student Skills". This Book tell you how to manage your time, manage
            your stress, how to take your note, and so on. I recomand those book

          <h2>Strategies</h2>
          <p>
            In the book of "The New Science Of Learning" there is a lot of idea
            or strategies to try. One of the stratage that I use are "Pattern
            and learning", "Mindsets toward learning", and "Paying attnions".
            There there helpes me a lot, The pattern and learning is about how
            to find patterns in what you learn and try to connect with the thing
            you know. I you this idea in one of my class it try to find the
            pattern between my understanding and the real world projects, It
            help to get priperd for the my futur job. The second idea is
            Mindsets, this helps me to be constante on my learn, which mean if I
            set me mind that i can pass all my class ans do all the requirmen,
            know i have mindsets to do all my work with motivations. The third
            idea is paying attanion. This idea wasn't quite easy beause I cannot
            fouce for a while it i am studing or learning, so i try to commbin
            my othe idea with this so each idea will can support each other. for
            example if i loss my attanion i try to find pttern of my learning so
            i can sty motivated or I give my self 5 minuits of break to not get
            board. Over all those strategies realy helps.
