              My name is Robera Desissa. I am currently in my third year at The
              Ohio State University, I study Electrical and Computer
              Engineering. For my majer I am planeing to learn Artificial
              Intelligence (AI). Technology inspires me a lot, so that is why I
              chose this kind of field as my major and miner. So to stay on
              task, I use many study tools and strategies from Books and my
              class "Learn & Motivation."

            The last two semesters weren't easy for me; I lacked motivation,
            time management, and paying attention. Because of that, my grade and
            motivation to learn went down. So this semester, I decided to change
            academically, mentally, and physically. The first thing I did was
            take a class that helped in my journey, so I took the "Learn and
            Motivation." This class is about helping college students with
            academics, showing methods and learning strategies. After this, I
            came up with two goals. The first goal is to use my time wisely
            (time management); because of a lack of time management last
            semester, I missed some of the due dates for my assignments. So plan
            to fix this using a time planner for each day; I plan to do my work
            on time. The second goal is to pay attention in my class or study.
            And this is the main thing because I can only manage my time if I
            focus and pay attention. So those two goals will restore the thing
            that I missed.

          <h2>BOOK</h2>
          <p>
            The Book that helps me my learning and gets motivated in all my
            classes and to get a better understanding of all courses is"The New
            Science Of Learning" by Terry Doyle and Todd Zakrajsek. This Book
            talks about how there are many ways to understand what you learn in
            class or anywhere, And it shows you the best strategy to use in any
            circumstance. One of the strategies I found most interesting that I
            start using is "Find a pattern in learning," so basically, the
            strategy is about how you connect what you learn with something and
            find what makes them the same or different if you can identify that
            you understand. This is one of many things that I have learned from
            this Book; there is a lot you should read this Book if you want to
            understand your learning differently and efficiently. There is
            another book that helped me as well, and this Book is called
            "College Student Skills". This Book tells you how to manage your
            time, stress, take notes, and so on. I recommend those books if you
            want to move forward in your success.

          <h2>Strategies</h2>
          <p>
            In the book "The New Science Of Learning," there are many ideas or
            strategies to try. One of the strategies that I use is "Pattern and
            learning", "Mindsets toward learning," and "Paying attention." There
            helps me a lot; the Pattern and learning are about how to find ways
            in what you learn and try to connect with the thing you know. I you
            this idea in one of my classes trying to find the Patterns between
            my understanding and the natural world projects help prepare me for
            my future job. The second idea is Mindsets help me to be constant in
            my learning, which means if I set my mind that I can pass all my
            classes and do all the requirements, I have the mindset to do all my
            work with motivation. The third idea is paying attention. This idea
            was challenging because I could not fouce for a while if I were
            studying or learning, so I tried to combine my other theory with
            this so each idea would support the other. For example, if I lose my
            attention, I try to find patterns in my learning so I can stay
            motivated or give myself five minutes of a break to not get bored.
            Over, all those strategies help.

            The thing that i learn from doing all this stup is that nothing is
            really hard if we try in different understanding, while we learn
            there is a lot of way to understand the concept. I fegured out it
            about which stratage for method you use when you leaning, it's about
            "how"
